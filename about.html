<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hello! My name is Efrain Rosales, and I am a diligent, fervent, and resilient college student interested in software engineering. As a small boy, I was always fascinated with the essence of programming when I witnessed the multi-colored code printed on the black canvas of the computer screen. From then on, my passion for technology and applications has since flourished. My willingness to learn and attempt new experiences produces a motivated and committed mindset fixed on obtaining a bachelor's degree in 
  Computer Science - software engineering for future career development.</p>
